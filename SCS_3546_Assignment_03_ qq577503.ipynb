    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Search Engines are a standard tool for finding relevant content. The calculation of similarity between textual information is an important factor for better search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal in this assignment is to calculate the textual similarity between queries and the provided sample documents, using a variety of NLP approaches.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In achieving the above goal, you will also:\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to preprocess text and embed textual data.\n",
    "- Compare the results of textual similarity scoring between traditional and deep-learning based NLP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data and Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the document repository provided by `sample_repository.json`, which you can download from the following link, or from the assignment description in Quercus: https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/286389/files/21993451/download?download_frd=1\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries you will run against these sample documents are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query 1: “fruits”\n",
    "- Query 2: “vegetables”\n",
    "- Query 3: “healthy foods in Canada”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Techniques to Demonstrate**\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques you will use to compute the similarity scores are:\n",
    "- 1. TF-IDF.\n",
    "- 2. Semantic similarity using GloVe word vectors.\n",
    "- 3. Semantic similarity using a BERT-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Feel Free to Choose Your Own Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "How you go about demonstrating each of the above techniques is up to you. You are not expected to use any particular library. The code below is just meant to provide you with some guidance to get started. You **do**, however, need to demonstrate obtaining similarity scores **with all 3 techniques above**, but how you go about doing this is totally up to you. The evaluation will be based on your ability obtain results using all three techniques, plus your discussion/comparison of any differences you observe.\n",

    "- Comparison and Discussion: 3 marks\n",
    "  - Compare all three techniques and interpret your findings. Do your best to explain the differences you observe in terms of concepts learned in class (not just the _what_, but also the _how_ and _why_ one technique produces different results from another).\n",
    "- Text Pre-Processing: 2 marks\n",
    " - Cleaning and standardization (e.g. lemmatization, stemming) in Experiment 1\n",
    " - Basic text cleaning (e.g. removal of special characters or tags) in Experiments 2 and 3.\n",
    "- Clarity: 2 marks\n",
    " - The marks for clarity are awarded for code documentation, clean code (e.g. avoiding repetition by building re-usable functions)  and how well you explained/supported your answers, including the use of visualizations.\n"

    "The raw TF-IDF approach relied entirely on exact word matching. As a result, documents were ranked highly only if they contained the same terms as the query. Any noise in the text influenced the scores and often pushed relevant documents lower in the ranking.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. TF-IDF after preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the text was cleaned, the results became more consistent and more relevant. The model no longer treated “fruit,” “fruits,” and “fruity” as unrelated terms, and removing common stopwords helped the important keywords dominate the similarity calculation.\n",
    "Although the method still depends on matching specific words, the preprocessing step significantly improved the quality of the rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Semantic similarity using embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding-based method delivered the most intuitive and meaningful results. Instead of focusing on exact words, it captured the conceptual similarity between the query and the documents. For example, a query related to “healthy foods” could surface documents discussing “nutrition,” “balanced diets,” or “vitamins,” even if the exact phrase never appeared.\n",
    "This happens because embeddings model the relationships between words in a continuous vector space, allowing the technique to recognize context and meaning rather than just term overlap."
